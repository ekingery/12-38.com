### What?

This is an app written to explore AJAX and also provide a radical way to spend every minute that is not 12:38 (waiting intently for that magical time return).

### What is 12:38?

12:38 is everything you've ever wanted it to be, nothing you don't want to be. Among other things, it is about not letting the gregorian calendar tell *you* when to party. 

### Todo

CSS sprites should have probably been used for the initial implementation. Converting to [node](http://nodejs.org/) would be a trendy move which might get around the need for CSS sprites.
